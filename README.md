## Manual Build for Development

### For M1 Chip Macs
At this moment, the project could only be compiled with `node` in `x64`. 
Please check the installed binary version of your `node` 
```
node -p process.arch
x64
```

If `arm64` is returned, please use Rosetta to open your favourite Shell
```
arch -x86_64 /bin/bash
```
Reinstall `node` v14 or v15 under Rosetta. It will install `node` in `x64` version by default. 

### Installation

yarn install
```
Installs all the needed dependencies
